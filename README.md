---

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. **Fork this repository.**
2. Go to your repository **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Secrets** and add the following secrets:

| Secret Name             | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AH_USERNAME`           | Your AimHarder email                                              |
| `AH_PASSWORD`           | Your AimHarder password                                           |
| `AH_BOX_ID`             | Box ID (gym ID - find via browser DevTools when booking manually) |
| `AH_BOX_NAME`           | Subdomain of your gym, e.g., `lahuellacrossfit`                   |
| `BOOKING_GOALS`         | JSON with class time/name goals (see example below)               |
| `HOURS_IN_ADVANCE`      | How many hours in advance the class becomes available for booking |
| `AH_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)                   |
| `AH_CHAT_ID`            | Your Telegram user ID (use a bot to get it, e.g., @userinfobot)   |

`AH_BOX_ID`: it's always the same one for your gym, you can find it inspecting the request made while booking a class from the browser:

### üß† Booking Goals Format

The `BOOKING_GOALS` secret should contain a JSON like this:

```json
{
  "0": {"time": "0700", "name": "CrossFit"},
  "2": {"time": "0700", "name": "Bike Class"},
  "4": {"time": "0700", "name": "Row Class"}
}
```

Where:

* `"0"` is Monday, `"2"` is Wednesday, `"4"` is Friday.
* `"time"` is the class time in 24h format (`HHMM`).
* `"name"` is part or all of the class name.

---

### üïí Schedule

By default, the GitHub Actions workflow runs on:

* Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday
* At **8:45 AM Venezuela time** (13:45 UTC)

You can adjust this in `.github/workflows/fitbot.yml` using the `cron` field.

---

### üí¨ Telegram Notifications

You‚Äôll get messages like this when a class is successfully booked:

```
üëã Hello @YourUsername!
‚úÖ Your class was successfully booked:

üïê Time: Monday, May 12 at 07:00 (VET)
üèãÔ∏è Class: Crossfit Muscle

üí™ Keep it up!
```

If something fails, the bot will also notify you with error info.

### ‚úÖ Want to Test It?
